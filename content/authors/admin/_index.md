I will join Columbia Business School as a PhD student in 2021 Fall!

I am a 4th year student majoring in computer science at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. I am generally interested in problems at the intersection of computer science and economics. I hope to use theoretical and modeling techniques to solve emerging problems with real-world impacts in interdisciplinary research areas.

During winter to summer 2020, I was a visiting student at California Institute of Technology, where I worked with [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Hongyao Ma](https://www.hongyaoma.com/) on online algorithms and ride-sharing markets. During summer 2019, I was a visiting student at University of Michigan, where I worked with [Grant Schoenebeck](http://schoeneb.people.si.umich.edu/) on information elicitation mechanisms.

"Yu" sounds like the French word "tu" without "t".
